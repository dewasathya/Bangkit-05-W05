### Preface

Predicting the Titanic's passenger survival with machine learning. With the input from Titanic Extended Dataset, this ML will predict the passengers survival based on some of the features available on the dataset.



### Requirements

The machine learning is programmed on Google Colaboratory's Notebook.



### File and Folders

1. The dataset is located on the folder 'titanic-extended'
   - 'full.csv' is the complete version of the dataset, not used for this project.
   - 'test.csv' is the dataset used for testing.
   - 'train.csv' is the dataset used for training the model.
2. The Colaboratory Notebook file is 'Bangkit 05-W05.ipynb'
3. 'evaluation_submission.csv' is the final result generated by the ML. The list contains the column PassengerId and Survived (0 = didn't survive, 1 = survive).
